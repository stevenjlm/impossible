# Impossible Hackathon: Project Aaki's Rankings

Code for streaming, storing, and ranking wishes on www.impossible.com. Content management on the website can use the rankings to help users post and search for wishes.

## Illustration

Imagine farmer Kevin in vegiville. Kevin uses impossible.com to share carrots from his garden with locals. Vegiville residents, however, read articles online that encourage eating more beats. They are posting to the website, but their wishes for beats are going unfulfilled.

Now imagine Teresa, a new vegiville resident. Teresa wants to start her own home garden, but doesn't know what to grow. Thanks to the rankings features on impossible.com she is able to search wishes that are going unfulfilled to identify local residents needs. Clearly, people want more beats.

Teresa starts growing beats in her garden while giving some to local residents. Vegiville residents are happier and the world is a better place!

## Progress Report

Check the "final" directory for operational code. All other directory's are for testing and debugging.

## Project Setup

To run the program you must first install the correct python modules listed in the "requirements.txt" file. You also need to laod the impossible.com database dumb onto a MySQL server.

Once this is done, simply type

```bash
~/final$python analyse_run1.py
```
in the shell.

## Works in Progress

### New Algorithms

Word trees, maximum entropy, SVM.

### Optimizations
